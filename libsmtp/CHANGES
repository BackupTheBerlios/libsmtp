0.7.5 * Cleaned up the code, many small bugs fixed
    
    * Integrated code cleanups and optimizations from Sean Reifschneider
    <jafo@tummy.com>. Thanks!
    
    * Tested on NetBSD
    
    * Integrated handling of 8 bit data. Now if a server can't handle 8bit
      data, the function just fails, otherwise it is transmitted correctly.
      
    * Functions that check for 8 bit user data added.
    
    * Functions that output error strings added (sorta strerr)
    
    * Test application added. Sends me a mail. Beware!
    
    * Some changes to the tracelog code to don't overwrite the end of
      the string. But I'm not quite sure this is right, so you better
      choose larger tracelogs (about 2k should suffice)
