I think autoconf is above me. For now, you'll have to do the following steps
to compile:

1) ./configure
   Ignore all the error messages :)

2) cd src

3) make
   Hold your breath now...

Now its up to you to do the rest, like copying the library to anyplace where
its useful, i.e. /usr/lib. The "testapp" application demonstrates the use of
libsmtp. You should adjust the mailserver address in "testapp.c" otherwise
your mail will just be rejected. You can send to the addresses that are
preconfigured in testapp.c if you like, they are sorted by my procmail and
get thrown away, so don't worry. If you like, you can set a funny email (or
your email address) in the From:-field, and my procmail script will save
them. :)
