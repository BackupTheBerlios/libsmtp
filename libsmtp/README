This is a small C library that allow direct SMTP connections conforming to
RFC 822. It is designed for security and simplicity. It is a complete
rewrite of libsmtp-0.7.5, and bears no similarity to it. Libsmtp is designed
to be small enough to be used in an embedded environment, and flexible
enough to be used as underlying communications infrastructure even for MTAs
(though it is still a bit away from that goal at the moment).

You can find updates at http://developer.berlios.de/projects/libsmtp/

Please note that this a development version. The next stable release will be
0.8. libsmtp-0.7.5 and below are deprecated.

See the file doc/API for programming information. The source code and the
test application are quite freely documented, too. Any patches, bug reports and
fixes and general comments welcome. Mailing list, forum, patch manager etc. are
at http://developer.berlios.de/projects/libsmtp/

Berlios is great!! Its sorta like sourceforge.net, but I like it when it
isn't so crowded :)
